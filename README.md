## Project Title: Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering for Geographical Pattern Analysis

### Overview:

This project focuses on the application of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, a widely used unsupervised learning technique, for geographical pattern analysis using satellite images. The goal is to identify and classify geographical features based on the values in satellite image datasets. The proposed clustering algorithm addresses shortcomings in traditional hierarchical clustering methods, particularly in distance measurement and cluster merging, resulting in improved accuracy.

### Project Objectives:

1. **Developing a Global Distance Measurement Method:**
   - Propose a global distance measurement method for optimal clustering.
   - Address the limitations of using only Euclidean distance by considering the distribution and structure characteristics of data points.

2. **Defining Internal Coherence and External Separability:**
   - Define internal coherence and external separability based on the global distance measurement.
   - Use these definitions to guide the merging of clusters in a more meaningful way.

3. **Experimentation and Evaluation:**
   - Conduct experiments on artificial and real datasets to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.
   - Compare results with traditional hierarchical clustering and other existing methods.
   - Highlight the algorithm's ability to overcome difficulties associated with Euclidean distance in revealing hidden information in data.

### Clustering Process Overview:

#### 1. Agglomeration Clustering Process:
   - Unsupervised learning technique for inferring data patterns without labels.
   - Starts by treating each data point as an individual cluster (leaf).
   - Iteratively merges clusters based on their distances, forming a tree-based representation known as a dendrogram.
   - The cut-off point for clustering is left to user discretion.

#### 2. Problem Statement:
   - Raw datasets from satellite images need analysis to cluster geographical patterns using the agglomerative clustering process.
   - Aims to identify and classify geographical features based on image values, aiding in understanding the differences and similarities between clusters.

### Usage Instructions:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensure the raw satellite image datasets are available.
   - Preprocess the data to remove noise, irrelevant features, or outliers if necessary.

2. **Run the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm:**
   - Utilize the provided notebook to run the proposed algorithm.
   - Adjust parameters as needed, such as the global distance measurement method and cluster merging criteria.

3. **Visualize and Analyze Results:**
   - Visualize the clustering results using dendrograms or other suitable representations.
   - Analyze the clusters to understand the geographical patterns and differences.
